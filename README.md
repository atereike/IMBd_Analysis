# IMBd_Analysis
## Introduction
This documentation outlines the data analysis performed on the IMDB dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal of the analysis was to gain insights into the dataset without employing machine learning techniques.

## Data Loading and Exploration
1. The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the `read_csv()` function.
2. Initial exploration of the dataset was performed using methods such as `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to understand the structure and content of the data.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. Missing values were handled by either dropping the corresponding rows or filling them with appropriate values using methods like `dropna()` and `fillna()`.

## Data Analysis
1. Statistical summaries, such as mean, median, and mode, were calculated for relevant columns using pandas functions like `mean()`, `median()`, and `mode()`.
2. Data visualization was performed using seaborn and matplotlib to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset.
3. Bar plots, histograms, and box plots were generated to visualize distributions, relationships, and outliers.

## Key Findings
1. The movie with the highest revenue in the dataset was found to be Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens with over 936 million.
2. The majority of movies were released in the year 2016.
## Conclusion
By leveraging the power of Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, we conducted a thorough data analysis of the IMDB dataset. The analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics, relationships, and distributions, enabling a better understanding of the data without resorting to machine learning techniques.
